# Stores

The `stores/` package centralises integrations with external services that power Mini RAG.

## Subpackages
- `llm/` — Factory, enums, and concrete providers for language model generation and embeddings. See the nested README for details.

Additional stores (vector databases, search indices, etc.) can be added here as the project expands.
